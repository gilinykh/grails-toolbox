If you do this, it will take longer to compile less file if you make changes when project is running (it has to compile both less files).</p>\n\n<p>To use this modules on your layout (i.e. main.gsp) include this lines of code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        ...\n        &lt;r:require module=\"yourstyle\"/&gt;\n        &lt;r:layoutResources /&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        ...\n        &lt;r:layoutResources /&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You need to add the <code>layoutResources</code> tag twice to your page, for the  resources and end-of-body resources (Because you can declare where do you want to include your resources, by default at the end of <code>body</code> tag). You can read more about how Grails Resources works at <a href=\"http://grails-plugins.github.com/grails-resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://grails-plugins.github.com/grails-resources/</a></p>\n\n<p>Note that 'your style' already depends on 'bootstrap', so you don't need to include both of them in your layout.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>I have been trying to integrate paypal in one of our grails applications. I need to create a monthly subscription wherein automatically payment will be transferred from paypal every month. For the purpose of testing I have created an account in sandbox and created a button for recurring payments. While creating the button I have also mentioned the success url and the cancellation url for IPN. Now while testing the application I see that on the button click the user is redirected to paypal and after logging in the payment also happens successfully. But the notification is not sent as yet. After the payment happens successfully a button appears asking the user whether he would like to return to the application. In case the user clicks on this button then he is redirected to the application else no notification is sent to the user. And also never do I get any notification for the cancellation of a recurring payment. If anyone has faced such a situation before kindly let me know the solution.</p>\n"
